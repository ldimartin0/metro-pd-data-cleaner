This repository contains functions to help data analysts, data journalists, and anyone else clean Metropolitan Police Department's (the police department for the Washington D.C. metropolitan area) stop data. The functions are written in R.

Metropolitan PD only released their data after a number of lawsuits filed by ACLU-DC, Black Lives Matter DC, and Stop Police Terror Project D.C.. Read local coverage of those lawsuits (here)[https://wjla.com/news/local/aclu-dc-lawsuit-mpd-stop-and-frisk-data-2020].

Metropolitan PD's data releases are highly, highly messy. These scripts contain functions that prepare this data for analysis.
